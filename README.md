# GreatFrontEnd Projects Challenge: Marketing 1

This repository contains **my personal attempt** at completing one of the [GreatFrontEnd Projects](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects) challenges.

I used the official starter template provided by GreatFrontEnd and implemented the design and functionality using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
This project was built as part of my ongoing front-end practice and portfolio development.

## About this project

This challenge provided a base template to recreate a design from GreatFrontEnd using custom code.  
The starter files included:

```
├── assets
│   └── dillon-sept-23.jpg
├── css
│   └── style.css
├── img
│   └── favicon.ico
├── .gitignore
├── index.html
└── README.md
```

I worked through the process of analyzing the design, structuring the HTML semantically, applying responsive CSS, and ensuring consistent layout and typography across breakpoints.

## Tools & Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **VS Code** for development
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment

## Credits
