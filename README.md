# GreatFrontEnd Projects Challenge — My Attempt

This repository contains **my personal attempt** at completing one of the [GreatFrontEnd Projects](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects) challenges.

I used the official starter template provided by GreatFrontEnd and implemented the design and functionality using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project was built as part of my ongoing front-end practice and portfolio development.

## About this project

This challenge provided a base template to recreate a design from GreatFrontEnd using custom code.  
The starter files included:

```
├── README.md
├── css
│   └── style.css
├── designs
├── img
├── index.html
└── js
    └── index.js
```

I worked through the process of analyzing the design, structuring the HTML semantically, applying responsive CSS, and ensuring consistent layout and typography across breakpoints.
